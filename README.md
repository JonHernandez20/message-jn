# message-jn

This is my first package that I publish, I took the course at [Platzi](https://platzi.com/cursos/npm/), you learn how to version, publish, create, update and remove packages. It is an excellent course, it has good theory and the necessary practice to understand how each command you use in the course works.

## Install

```npm
npm install -g message-jn
```

# Usage

```bash
message-jn
```
